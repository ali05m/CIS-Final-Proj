# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Predictor

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project would be a software that does not buy or sell stocks but instead shows the predictions of increase or decrease. This would let the user insert the specific ticker and show a 72 hour or week span of what it will predict the market would look like.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will surf the web for all information revolving the particular ticker and produce predictable information about how much will it increase or decrease. As well as look at the highs, lows, open, and closing price. This will figure out its average movement and attempt to predict its future movement. This information and statistics will hopefully be compiled and measured either through my own program or through a external program to provide a outcome showing its increase or decrease within a 72 hour or week window. My program will also show you the level of risk and uncertainty of its prediction.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I hope to at least accomplish reading and compiling the number data provided by the charts to give at least a prediction of what is the bare minimum increase or decrease while still having at least 60% certainty of my prediction.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is using more than number data to provide accurate data. Which means I hope I can figure out how to get my program to surf the web as well finding articles, and any publication about the specific ticker and any related to it that might effect its prediction. Which means I hope my predictions would be more than 60% and aim for 70% of accuracy.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To understand stock volatility and use this understanding to predict its movement as well as use past charts of the same ticker to cross check them and mimic its future movement as well as involve everything mentioned in the above questions. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Understanding Stock Volatility and stick candle charts. I will need to research what are relevant news that cause the increase or decrease in prices. I will look into different sectors and find there correlated sectors and see how much a fall or a rise in one sector can affect another. Looking into where my project would be ineffective for unpredictable sectors or categorized stocks (ie. penny stocks).
